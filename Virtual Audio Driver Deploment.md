Here's a suggested README for deploying your tested virtual audio driver to another machine using the Windows Driver Kit (WDK). It assumes the driver is signed and ready for installation.

## **📘 Virtual Audio Driver Deployment Guide**
This README provides instructions for installing the Virtual Audio Driver on a target Windows machine. Ensure you have administrative privileges before proceeding.
### **📦 Contents of the Deployment Package**
- [VirtualAudioDriver.sys](https://virtualaudiodriver.sys/) – The driver binary
- [VirtualAudioDriver.inf](https://virtualaudiodriver.inf/) – Installation script
- [VirtualAudioDriver.cat](https://virtualaudiodriver.cat/) – Signed catalog file
- [README.txt](https://readme.txt/) – This guide
- (Optional) [Installer.exe](https://installer.exe/) – Custom installer (if provided)

### **🛠️ Installation Steps**
#### ***1. Pre-Installation Checklist***
- Ensure the target machine matches the driver’s architecture (x64 or x86).
- Disable Driver Signature Enforcement only if testing unsigned drivers (not recommended for production).
- Open a Command Prompt window as Administrator. Then enter the following command:

  bcdedit /set TESTSIGNING ON

  and reboot the system.

Important

Before using BCDEdit to change boot information you may need to temporarily suspend Windows security features such as BitLocker and Secure Boot on the test PC.


- Right click on package.cer file and click install for installing the signing certificate
#### ***2. Manual Installation via Device Manager***
1. Press Win + X → select **Device Manager**.
1. Click **Action** → **Add legacy hardware**.
1. Choose **Install the hardware that I manually select from a list**.

1. Click **Have Disk** → browse to the folder containing [VirtualAudioDriver.inf](https://virtualaudiodriver.inf/).
1. Follow the prompts to complete installation.
#### ***3. Installation via Command Line***
Use pnputil or devcon (from WDK):

pnputil /add-driver VirtualAudioDriver.inf /install

Or with devcon:

devcon install VirtualAudioDriver.inf Root\VirtualAudioDriver

Replace Root\VirtualAudioDriver with your actual hardware ID if different.

### **🔄 Uninstallation**
#### ***Manual:***
- Go to **Device Manager**, right-click the virtual audio device, and choose **Uninstall**.
#### ***Command Line:***
pnputil /delete-driver VirtualAudioDriver.inf /uninstall

### **🧪 Verification**
After installation:

- Open **Sound Settings** → check if the virtual audio device appears under input/output.
- Use tools like Audacity or OBS to verify routing and capture.
