# Virtual Audio Driver by MikeTheTech (Modified - Microphone Only)

**üé§ This is a modified version that provides ONLY virtual microphone functionality with named pipe input support.**

Welcome to the **Modified Virtual Audio Driver**! This version has been specifically modified to:

- **‚úÖ Provide only virtual microphone input** (speaker output completely removed)
- **‚úÖ Accept audio data exclusively via named pipe interface**
- **‚úÖ Support IOCTL-based direct audio injection**
- **‚úÖ Prevent other applications from using the microphone as standard input**

**Original Features Removed:**
- ‚ùå Virtual speaker output device  
- ‚ùå Audio rendering/playback capabilities
- ‚ùå Property pages for external application input

The modified virtual audio driver provides:

- **Virtual Microphone with Named Pipe Input** ‚Äì A virtual microphone that accepts audio data exclusively through a named pipe interface (`\\.\pipe\VirtualMicInput_0`), perfect for applications that need to inject custom audio data programmatically.

## Key Modifications

This version has been specifically modified for applications requiring:
- **Exclusive control over microphone input** ‚Äì Only your application can provide audio data
- **Programmatic audio injection** ‚Äì Send audio data directly via named pipe or IOCTL
- **No interference from other apps** ‚Äì Standard Windows audio applications cannot access the microphone
- **Simplified driver architecture** ‚Äì Microphone-only implementation reduces complexity

## Named Pipe Interface

Your applications can send audio data to the virtual microphone using:

```
Pipe Name: \\.\pipe\VirtualMicInput_0
Format: 16-bit PCM, 44.1kHz, Stereo
Access: Write-only from user applications
```

See [NAMED_PIPE_USAGE.md](NAMED_PIPE_USAGE.md) for detailed usage examples and API documentation.

## Quick Start with Named Pipes

1. **Install the driver** using Device Manager (see Installation section below)
2. **Run an example application** to create the named pipe:
   ```bash
   # C++ Example  
   cd examples
   cl CreatePipeExample.cpp && CreatePipeExample.exe
   
   # Python Example (requires: pip install pywin32 numpy)
   python create_pipe_example.py
   ```
3. **Set the virtual microphone** as your default recording device in Windows Sound Settings
4. **Test with any application** that uses microphone input (Discord, OBS, etc.)

**üìÅ Example Applications**: Check the [`examples/`](examples/) directory for complete working examples in C++ and Python that demonstrate proper named pipe creation and usage.
